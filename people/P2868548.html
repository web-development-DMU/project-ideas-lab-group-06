    <h1>Kheya</h1>
    <p>
     I'm completely new to web development. I haven't written 
     HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before, so this module is my first 
     real introduction to how websites are built. I've seen bits 
     of code online, but I've never created a webpage myself. </p>
    <p>
      I'm hoping to learn the basics of how websites work, how to 
      structure pages properly.

        plan weekly spending and manage their money more effectively.</li>
      <li>
        Streaming Cost Calculator - A quick calculator that shows the

        Workout by Mood - a simple web app that helps users choose the right
        workout based on how they feel. Instead of searching for routines 
        or forcing themselves into a strict plan, users can select their 
        current mood, and the app suggests a short, suitable workout that 
        matches their energy level.
