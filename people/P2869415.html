    <h2>Alfie Tones</h2>
    <p>
        I am Alfie, studying Computer Science. I have a keen interest in web development and software engineering. I've built multiple projects that involve user-friendly interfaces and backend systems. I've made a gym tracking app and an expenses tracker, I also have experience with databases. I like working on projects that have real-world applications and that help me in my daily life!

I am excited to work with my team and contribute my skills to create something useful and practical! I am hoping to get better at team collaboration whilst also improving my web development skills!
