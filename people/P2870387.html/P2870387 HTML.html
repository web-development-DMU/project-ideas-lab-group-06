    <h1>Who is Adwoa Opoku-Menkah?</h1>
    <p>
    Hello team, my name is Adwoa and I am a second year Computer Science student at DMU. I have a fundamental understanding of web development through the work I have completed on github in my prior to first year of uni. I created a website for tourists visiting Cyprus, based on my experience whilst living there. The page contained information about tourist attractions, modes of transport and nearby resturants.

     <p>
    I am interested to see what new skills I can obtain in this module as I would like to create my own website for my hair business.

        <h2>What do I know about HTML?</h2>
            <p>
    I know that HTML is not a coding language, but rather a markup langauage that is used in web development. Markup languages are tools that determine how informatiuon will be presented on a page. For example, the font size, background colour and page alignment of a website.
