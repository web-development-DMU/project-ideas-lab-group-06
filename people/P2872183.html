         <h1>Thanaa</h1>
                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Thanaa, and I'm a second year computer science student.</p>
               
                <h2>What experience do I have in web development?</h2>
                <p>I have little experience in web development but it's been a long time, so I'll have to refresh my knowledge of it. Although, I do remember enjoying the learning process thoroughly.</p>


                <h2>What am I keen to learn from this module?</h2>
                <p>I am keen to learn how to use CSS and HTML (again...), and JavaScript, which I've never attempted before.
                   And in the coming weeks we'll be developing our applications, so that's something I'm looking forward to.</p>
               
                <h2>What kind of project would I like to be involved in?</h2>
                <p>I would like to be involved in a project that inspires creativity and allows me to apply the knowledge that I've gained throughout the module.</p>
