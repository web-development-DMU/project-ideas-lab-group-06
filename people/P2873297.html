    <p>
        I am Oli, studying Computer Science. I have a strong interest in web development and am excited to learn more about it in this module. I have some experience with HTML from secondary school and CSS from personal/coursework projects, and I am looking forward to improve my skills throughout this module.

    <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A portfolio website to present students projects and skills.
            This could help students manage their work and showcase their abilities to potential employers. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A tracker website for personal habits such as sleep, exercise or study time.
            This could help users monitor their progress and stay motivated in achieving their goals.
        </li>
        <li>
            A recipe sharing website where users can upload and share their favorite recipes.
            This could create a community of food enthusiasts and provide a platform for sharing culinary ideas and inspiration as well as meeting people of similar interests.
        </li>
    </ul>
