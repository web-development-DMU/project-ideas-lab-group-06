<h1>Sinayomi Kolawole</h1>
<p>hello my name is sinayomi kolawole and im a dmu second year student who has no experience in web developement. im keen to learn how to code websites and applications so i can start making them for family and friends.</p>

</body>
<h2> what i want to make </h2>
<p> i want to make a Student Budget and Expense Tracker which could be a clean website where users can track spending, this website would allow students to:</p>
<ul> <li> Add income (e.g., student loan, job)
     <li> Add expenses (food, rent, transport)
     <li> View spending by category
     <li> See a simple chart of where money goes
     <li> Add expenses (food, rent, transport) </ul>
<p> A few more ideas i have are:</p>
<ul> <li> Student Study Planner Website
     <li> Personal Habit Tracker Website </ul>
