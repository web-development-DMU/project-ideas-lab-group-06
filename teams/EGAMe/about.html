            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
                EGAMe is a team of three passionate Computer Science students studying at De Montfort University.
                United by our love for gaming and technology, we set out to build an ecommerce platform that makes
                buying games simple, affordable, and enjoyable for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our name stands for our shared enthusiasm — we live and breathe games, and we want to bring that
                energy to every customer who visits our store.
            </p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>
                We offer a curated selection of games spanning every genre — from action-packed adventures and
                immersive RPGs to competitive multiplayer titles and relaxing indie experiences. Whether you are
                a casual player or a hardcore gamer, EGAMe has something for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform lets you browse, add games to your basket, and check out with ease. We have built
                a straightforward shopping experience so you can spend less time navigating menus and more time
                playing.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                We believe that great games should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to provide a
                trustworthy and user-friendly platform where gamers can find their next favourite title without
                breaking the bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                As students ourselves, we understand the value of a good deal. That is why we are committed to
                offering competitive prices and a hassle-free experience from start to finish.
