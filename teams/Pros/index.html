    <h2>Our Application</h2>
    <p>
        We are creating an application for booking trips around Europe.
        The web application will allow you to create an account, and book a trip by choosing a country, a city and then a hotel.
        We want to aim for the user to be able to filter hotels further by room size, nearby attractions (e.g. train stations, beaches etc.).
