            We are a team of two members, Alfie <a href="/people/P2869415.html">[link to Alfie's profile]</a> and Joshua <a href="/people/P2872504.html">[link to Josh's profile]</a>.

        <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
        <p>
            Me and Josh have decided to go with an application we call Caloryx. <a href = "/proposals/Caloryx.html">[found here.]</a>
        </p>  
        <p>
            Caloryx is an application that allows users to track their calorie intake and expenditure. We plan to keep the application simple, and thus user-friendly. The application will allow users to input their meals and exercises, and will then calculate the total calories consumed and burned. The application will also provide users with a daily calorie goal based on their age, gender, weight, and activity level. We're hoping that this application will help users (including ourselves) to keep on track of thier fitness goals!
