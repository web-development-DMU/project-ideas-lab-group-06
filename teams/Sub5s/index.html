            We are a team of two members, Alfie <a href="/people/P2869415.html">[link to Alfie's profile]</a> and Joshua <a href="/people/P2872504.html">[link to Josh's profile]</a>.

        <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
        <p>
            Me and Josh have decided to go with an application we call Caloryx. <a href = "/proposals/Caloryx.html">[found here.]</a>
        </p>  
        <p>
            Caloryx is an application that allows users to track their calorie intake and expenditure. We plan to keep the application simple, and thus user-friendly. The application will allow users to input their meals and exercises, and will then calculate the total calories consumed and burned. The application will also provide users with a daily calorie goal based on their age, gender, weight, and activity level. We're hoping that this application will help users (including ourselves) to keep on track of thier fitness goals!

        <h3>Database Structure.</h3>
        <p>
            We plan to use a simple database structure for our application. We will have a users table that will store user information such as username, password, age, gender. We will also have a meals table that will store information about the meals that users input, such as the name of the meal, the calories, and the user who inputted it. Finally, we will have an exercises table that will store information about the exercises that users input, such as the name of the exercise, the calories burned, and the user who inputted it.
