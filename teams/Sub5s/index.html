            <p>
            We are a team of two members, Alfie <a href="/people/P2869415.html">[link to Alfie's profile]</a> and Joshua <a href="/people/P2872504.html">[link to Josh's profile]</a>.

        <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
        <p>
            Me and Josh have decided to go with an application we call Caloryx. <a href = "/proposals/Caloryx.html">[found here.]</a>
        </p>  
        <p>
            Caloryx is an application that allows users to track their calorie intake and expenditure. We plan to keep the application simple, and thus user-friendly. The application will allow users to input their meals and exercises, and will then calculate the total calories consumed and burned. The application will also provide users with a daily calorie goal based on their age, gender, weight, and activity level. We're hoping that this application will help users (including ourselves) to keep on track of thier fitness goals!

        <h3>Database Structure.</h3>
        <p>
            We plan to use a simple database structure for our application. We will have a users table that will store user information such as username, password, age, gender. We will also have a meals table that will store information about the meals that users input, such as the name of the meal, the calories, and the user who inputted it. Finally, we will have an exercises table that will store information about the exercises that users input, such as the name of the exercise, the calories burned, and the user who inputted it.

        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to keep the user interface of our application simple and user-friendly. We will use a clean and minimalistic design, with a focus on functionality. The main page of the application will display the user's daily calorie goal, as well as their total calories consumed and burned for the day. Users will be able to easily navigate to the meals and exercises pages to input their information.

        <h2>Routes</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to have the following routes for our application:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>/ - Home page</li>
            <li>/login - Login page</li>
            <li>/register - Registration page</li>
            <li>/dashboard - User dashboard</li>
            <li>/meals - Meals input page</li>
            <li>/exercises - Exercises input page</li>
        </ul>

    <section class = "prototypes">
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
            We have created static HTML prototypes for each GET route in the application. These give a visual impression of what each page will look like, using realistic example data.
        </p>
        <p>
            A narrative user journey document walks through the full application flow — from a new user landing on the home page all the way through to everyday use and the admin panel — with each step illustrated by an embedded prototype page.
